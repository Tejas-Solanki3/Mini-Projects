      <p>
        By day, he's Bruce Wayne — billionaire philanthropist and CEO of Wayne Enterprises.
        By night, he is Batman: Gotham City's relentless protector, born from tragedy and
        driven by justice.
      </p>

      <p>
        Batman operates in the shadows, striking fear into the hearts of criminals. With no
        superpowers, his brilliance, martial arts mastery, and tactical genius make him one
        of the most formidable members of the Justice League.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Batcave serves as his command center, housing cutting-edge technology, the Batcomputer,
        and vehicles like the Batmobile and Batwing. His iconic suit is reinforced armor with
        advanced tools — grappling hooks, smoke bombs, and the legendary Batarangs.
      </p>

      <p>
        His mission is simple: protect Gotham, uphold justice, and ensure no one suffers as he did.
        Whether facing the Joker, Bane, or Ra’s al Ghul, Batman stands unwavering — a symbol of hope
        born in darkness.
